History:

This application was originally written to test an experimental branch of ExoPlayer. At the time, this branch had an open pull request that hadn&#39;t been merged after several years:

<blockquote>

<a href="https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/3854">https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/3854</a>

</blockquote>

Eventually, this branch was merged. Now, this application uses a stable build of ExoPlayer. Which, imho, makes it less interesting. But it may still be useful.
