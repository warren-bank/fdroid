These formats are typical of inexpensive IP security cameras.

Features include the ability to:

* import video streams from a JSON file
* each stream can include URLs for two sources:
  - low resolution
  - high resolution
* selectively enable and disable streams in the list
* display the enabled streams in either a list or grid layout
  - uses low resolution (when available)
* select a single stream from the list or grid layout
  - displays in full screen
  - uses high resolution (when available)

History:

This application was originally written to test an experimental branch of ExoPlayer. At the time, this branch had an open pull request that hadn't been merged after several years:
  https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/3854

Eventually, this branch was merged. Now, this application uses a stable build of ExoPlayer. Which, imho, makes it less interesting. But it may still be useful.
