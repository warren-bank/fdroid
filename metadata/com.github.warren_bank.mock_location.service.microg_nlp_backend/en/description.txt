Allows "Mock my GPS" to behave as a mock location provider for "UnifiedNlp".

"UnifiedNlp" is:

* typically installed as a component of "microG"
* intended for use on de-Googled Android ROMs
* a drop-in replacement for "Google Location Services"

"UnifiedNlp" integration of mock location data:

* is only enabled while "Mock my GPS" is active
* is prioritized over other "UnifiedNlp" backend plugins by advancing the timestamp 45 seconds, so it appears to be most recent
