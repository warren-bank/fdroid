Allows &quot;Mock my GPS&quot; to behave as a mock location provider for &quot;UnifiedNlp&quot;.

&quot;UnifiedNlp&quot; is:

<ul>
<li>typically installed as a component of &quot;microG&quot;</li>
<li>intended for use on de-Googled Android ROMs</li>
<li>a drop-in replacement for &quot;Google Location Services&quot;</li>
</ul>

&quot;UnifiedNlp&quot; integration of mock location data:

<ul>
<li>is only enabled while &quot;Mock my GPS&quot; is active</li>
<li>is prioritized over other &quot;UnifiedNlp&quot; backend plugins
by advancing the timestamp 45 seconds,
so it appears to be most recent</li>
</ul>
