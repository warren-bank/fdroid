Allows "Mock my GPS" to behave as a mock location provider for "UnifiedNlp".

"UnifiedNlp" is:

● typically installed as a component of
&nbsp;&nbsp;"microG"
● intended for use on de-Googled Android ROMs
● a drop-in replacement for "Google Location
&nbsp;&nbsp;Services"

"UnifiedNlp" integration of mock location data:

● is only enabled while "Mock my GPS" is
&nbsp;&nbsp;active
● is prioritized over other "UnifiedNlp"
&nbsp;&nbsp;backend plugins by advancing the timestamp
&nbsp;&nbsp;45 seconds, so it appears to be most recent
