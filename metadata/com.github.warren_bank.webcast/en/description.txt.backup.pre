Video URLs on the current web page are displayed in a list.

Settings determine the behavior when a video URL is selected:
* the internal video player includes a Chromecast sender
* the external video player allows another app to play the video URL
* the "ExoAirPlayer" and "HLS Proxy" senders each load a static web page SPA client for the chosen server
