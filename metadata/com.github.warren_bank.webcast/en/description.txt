Video URLs on the current web page are displayed in a list.

Settings determine the behavior when a video URL is selected:
● the internal video player includes a
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chromecast sender
● the external video player allows another
&nbsp;&nbsp;app to play the video URL
● the "ExoAirPlayer" and "HLS Proxy" senders
&nbsp;&nbsp;each load a static web page SPA client for
&nbsp;&nbsp;the chosen server
