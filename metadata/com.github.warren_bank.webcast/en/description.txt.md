Video URLs on the current web page are displayed in a list.

Settings determine the behavior when a video URL is selected:
* the internal video player includes a _Chromecast_ sender
* the external video player allows another app to play the video URL
* the _"ExoAirPlayer"_ and _"HLS Proxy"_ senders
  each load a static web page SPA client for the chosen server
