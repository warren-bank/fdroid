Features include the ability to:

● configure and save any number of
&nbsp;&nbsp;application profiles
● each application profile can specify:
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ title
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ file path to main Javascript file
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ command line options for the Node.js
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runtime
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ command line options for the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ environment variables
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ current working directory
● application profiles are grouped by:
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ "exec"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications share a single
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process. Only one can execute at a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ "fork"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each application is given its own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process. Each executes in a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreground service. An associated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notification kills the process.
● backup and restore:
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ export all application profiles to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JSON
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ import new application profiles from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JSON
