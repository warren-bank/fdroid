Features include the ability to:

● configure and save any number of
&nbsp;&nbsp;application profiles
● each application profile can specify:
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ title
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ file path to main Javascript file
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ command line options for the Node.js
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runtime
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ command line options for the application
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ environment variables
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ current working directory
● application profiles are grouped by:
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ "exec"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications share a single process.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one can execute at a time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ "fork"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each application is given its own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process. Each executes in a foreground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service. An associated notification
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kills the process.
● backup and restore:
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ export all application profiles to JSON
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ import new application profiles from JSON
