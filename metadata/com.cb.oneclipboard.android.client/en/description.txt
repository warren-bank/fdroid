Servers are available for a variety of platforms, including Android.

All clients that connect to a common server and authenticate using the same username and password combination will share a common clipboard. Whenever any client copies new data into its clipboard, this data is sent to the server and then broadcast to all authenticated clients.

All clipboard data is encrypted end-to-end.

Tasker integration is supported.
