Listens on the Wi-Fi LAN adapter using a stateless HTTP API (based on AirPlay v1). Advertises its availability for discovery using mDNS (Bonjour).

Supports devices of all display sizes; inexpensive generic set-top boxes with high-resolution HDMI output are the target platform, but works equally well on very old handsets with very small low-resolution screens.

The API is extensive and fully documented. A static web page SPA client implementation makes this functionality highly accessible. At its most basic level, this API provides the ability to "cast" media URLs into a playlist and control all aspects of playback.
