Features include:

* detection of userscript URLs
* automatic userscript updates
* an extended Javascript API
  to expose Android specific capabilities
* the ability to ignore HTTPS certificate errors

Limitations:

* userscripts only run in the top window
  - script injection into iframes is possible,
    but requires a complicated workaround;
    refer to the README for details.
